We will use MLP to build our very own Word2Vec model.\n","\n","The need for these algorithms comes from the fact that machine learning models operate on numbers but not text.  Because of this, before you train your text model, you first need a method to map your text into numbers.\n","\n","Perhaps the most naive way to do so is by assigning a random number to each word.  For example, let's say we have the following text (taken from Dr Suess, Green Eggs and Ham):\n","\n","<center>\n","\n","> *I do not like them here or there.* <br>\n","> *I do not like them anywhere.* <br>\n","> *I do not like green eggs and ham.*\n","</center>\n","\n","We *could* just assign numbers randomly, and one such mapping could be\n","\n","```python\n","word_to_index = {\n","  'I': 0,     'them': 1,     'here': 2,    ...\n","  'there': 9, 'eggs': 10,    'do': 11      ...\n","  'ham': 16\n","}\n","```\n","\n","but the problem with this approach is that it does not encode *any* information about the meanings of the words at all.  For example, 'eggs' and 'ham' are similar words (both are food), but have vastly different values (eggs is 10, ham is 16).  \n","\n","To illustrate the problem with this, let's say you give your model the word 'green', in the hope that it predicts the next word to be 'eggs'.  After training for a few epochs, it predicts the next word to be 'I', which is obviously wrong.  You train your model for a few more epochs and re-feed the word 'green'.  Now it predicts the next word to be 'ham'.  You want to tell the model that it did a better job than before, but since the numbers associated with each word are assigned randomly, you cannot use the difference between the numbers to tell your model that it got closer to the true answer.  In other words, you are unable to tell your model anything other than \"you got it right\" or \"you got it wrong\".  This makes training your model much harder.\n","\n","A good mapping should, therefore, map similar words close to each other, which is the goal of Word2Vec.  The following *2D semantic space* shows an example of what we want to achieve.\n","\n","*(If the image does not load, run the code cell for \"2D Sematic Space\" in the appendix of the notebook to generate the image)*\n","\n","![img](https://course.cse.ust.hk/comp2211/assignments/pa2/images/2d_semantic_space.png)"],"metadata":{"id":"Ucepd5-c8vOD"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Using the two *semantic features* \"animal\" and \"food\", we are able to encode the words above in a much more meaningful way.  Each word is now represented by a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ (a list of 2 real numbers) and positioned such that similar words are clustered together:\n","\n","<center>\n","\n","|           | food (x-axis) | animal (y-axis) |\n","|-----------|:-------------:|:---------------:|\n","| llama     |      0.25     |       5.25      |\n","| dog       |      0.5      |        5        |\n","| frog      |      0.75     |       4.75      |\n","| coriander |       5       |        1        |\n","| ...       |      ...      |       ...       |\n","\n","</center>\n","\n","**Question**: Where do you think the words \"rat\", \"lamb\", and \"grapes\" would be placed?\n","\n","This is already a great step up from giving each word random values.  But why stop at just 2 semantic features?  Let's say we want to add the words \"cat\", \"rabbit\" and \"hamster\" to the semantic space.  They would probably be placed in the top-left corner, together with \"llama\", \"dog\", and \"frog\".  But obviously, cats, dogs, rabbits and hamsters have something else in common: they are all pets!  So, it would make sense to add a \"pet\" semantic feature, enriching our semantic space.  The result may look something like the following picture:\n","\n","*(If the image does not load, run the code cell for \"3D Sematic Space\" in the appendix of the notebook to generate the image)*\n","\n","![img](https://course.cse.ust.hk/comp2211/assignments/pa2/images/3d_semantic_space.png)"],"metadata":{"id":"O2tNZG-R-7qZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Now, we have encoded each word as a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ (a list of 3 real numbers):\n","\n","<center>\n","\n","|           | food (x-axis) | animal (y-axis) | pet (z-axis) |\n","|-----------|:-------------:|:---------------:|:------------:|\n","| llama     |      0.25     |       5.25      | 0 |\n","| dog       |      0.5      |        5        | 5 |\n","| frog      |      0.75     |       4.75      | 1 |\n","| coriander |       5       |        1        | 0 |\n","| ...       |      ...      |       ...       |...|\n","\n","</center>\n","\n","But there is no reason to stop at 3 semantic features.  Evidently, by continuously adding even more semantic features (dimensions), our Word2Vec model can become even more expressive and capable of capturing the different intertwined meanings of our vocabulary.  \n","\n","Typically, large language models use Word2Vec models with 300 dimensions - a list of 300 real numbers for *each* vocabulary!  What's more, Word2Vec models are trained in an unsupervised manner.  This means that we do not supply the labels (i.e. \"food\", \"animal\", \"pet\") to the dimensions.\n"," Instead, we ask the model to learn them itself."],"metadata":{"id":"Ywa1FKIjOpue"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["There are 2 methods we can use to learn the dimensions: the **continuous bag of words** (CBOW) approach and the **skip-gram** approach.

Let's illustrate the differences by considering the following sentence:\n","\n","> The Sydney Opera House is a multi-venue performing arts centre in Sydney.\n","\n","In the **continuous bag of words** approach, **the goal is to predict *one* target word from a few context words**.

The output is run through a softmax function to determine which word the model predicts.\n","\n","Note that the model architecture doesn't change no matter if we use the continuous bag of words or skip-gram approach, the only difference lies in how we encode the input words.\n","\n","At this point, you may wonder how predicting context words can help us \"group similar words together\".  Notice that our ultimate goal is to find a function that maps words to vectors of 300 dimensions and not predict context words, and in fact, our $T_1$ linear layer does exactly that:  it takes in a one-hot vector representing the word and outputs a vector in 300 dimensions.\n","\n","\n","In the following tasks, we will build our own Word2Vec model.

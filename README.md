# Projects of ML

## Getting Started

### Project Description

**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Wine Quality Prediction Project**

- Developed a KNN regressor from scratch using NumPy to predict wine quality based on chemical attributes.
- Worked with the UCI Machine Learning Repository's Wine Quality dataset, handling a dataset with 4,898 instances and 12 attributes.
- Implemented data preprocessing techniques, model building, and evaluation using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
- Conducted 5-fold cross-validation to determine the optimal 'K' value for the KNN model.

**Word2Vec Model Project**

- Explored Word2Vec, an algorithm used in natural language processing to convert text into numerical representations.
- Constructed a Word2Vec model using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to learn semantic features from text.
- Utilized the continuous bag of words (CBOW) and skip-gram approaches to train the model on a dataset derived from Wikipedia articles.
- Generated training data, applied one-hot encoding, and built a model using Keras, resulting in a semantic space visualization.

**Naive Bayes Classifier Project**

- Implemented a Naive Bayes Classifier for predicting the likelihood of survival on the Titanic.
- Loaded and preprocessed datasets containing features such as age, fare, gender, and social class, treating certain numerical features as categorical due to limited distinct values.
- Calculated class priors and likelihoods to predict survival labels, achieving a certain level of accuracy (specify the accuracy if available).

**Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning Project**

- Developed a Connect-4 game using the Minimax algorithm and Alpha-Beta Pruning technique.
- Set gaming parameters, implemented game mechanics, and created a class for Connect-4, including methods for creating the board, dropping pieces, and checking win conditions.
- Designed AI decision-making processes to evaluate board states and select optimal moves.
- Implemented the minimax function to determine the best move for both AI and human players, improving the AI's performance and reducing computational complexity with Alpha-Beta Pruning.
